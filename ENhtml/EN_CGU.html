                     The member retains all of his intellectual property rights. However, any
                     publication on the site implies the delegation of the non-exclusive and free right to the company
                     publisher to represent, reproduce, modify, adapt, distribute and disseminate the publication
                     anywhere and on any medium for the duration of the intellectual property. It may
                     be done directly or through an authorized third party. This concerns in particular the right

                    This contract is subject to French law. The lack of amicable resolution of
